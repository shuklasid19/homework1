The first passenger in line crazily decides to sit in a randomly chosen seat (with all seats equally likely). Each subsequent passenger takes his or her assigned seat if available, and otherwise sits in a random available seat. What is the probability that the last passenger in line gets to sit in his or her assigned seat?\n","\n","⦁\tThis is probably the ugliest solution possible to this problem but here goes. Let’s first consider a special case where there are only 2 people (Sonu and Monu) and 2 seats on the airplane. Sonu  picks a seat at random. The only way Monu  gets to pick his designated seat is if Sonu correctly picks hers. Since there are only 2 choices for Monu  she picks her own seat correctly with probability 1/21/2\n","\n","Therefore P(P( Monu gets his seat)=P()=P(Sonu  chooses her own seat)=1/2)=1/2\n"],"metadata":{"id":"71FmqC4JdWfT"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[""],"metadata":{"id":"YwblnzsddXKx"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
